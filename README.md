# angular-ddd
A sample Angular app to experiment with Domain Driven Design concepts in a Functional Reactive Programming context.

The question is, does Domain Driven Design, which is largely from the Object Oriented world, have any application in a the functional reactive paradigm of the rxjs driven Angular. 

The aim of this repo is to slowly put together the framework of an app the extends past the trivial To-do CRUD sample apps that abound, and see if modeling this around DDD principles helps at all to tame some of the complexity that can arise when Angular/Ngrx based apps extend past a couple of simple add/edit/list components.
